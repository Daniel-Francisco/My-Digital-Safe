        <div class="faqAnswer">My Digital Safe used the PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA256. This cryptographic hash function is
            used to derive the hash to validate your password and ultimately
            derive the symmetric encryption key to protect your data. Simple version? We take your password and turn it
            into a irreversible garbled mess of characters using a 'hashing' function.
            Some very smart Mathematicians create and validate the effectiveness of this hashing function and security
            developers such as ourselves can use it in our applications. This 'hash'
            is impossible to convert back into your password, and we can re-calculate the hash each time you log in. If
            the hash we calculate matches the stored hash, your login is successful.

        <div class="faqQuestion">How does My Digital Safe secure my data?<img src="images/arrow_down.png"
                                                                              class="arrow"/></div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">We encrypt all of your data using AES-256 algorithm before storing it in a database on
            your phone. The key to this algorithm is calculated through the PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA256
            algorithm during the password hashing process. In simplified terms, we use your password to encrypt and
            decrypt your data. With a strong password, this data is impossible to decrypt. Therefore,
            pick a good password to take advantage of maximum security!
