        Hello and welcome to My Digital Safe!

        My Digital Safe is a security first note-keeping app for your Android device. Unlike other apps available on the
        Google Play Store, My Digital Safe was designed with security as the top priority. Despite all of the built-in
        encryption and protections, My Digital Safe strides to ensure the simplest experience possible for you, the
        user.

        The consumer software industry is filled with appâ€™s claiming to provide users with a level of security they can
        trust, yet they will never allow an external source audit their source code. At My Digital Safe, we believe our
        transparency is one of our greatest strengths. We have practiced open-source philosophy since day one. As of
        now, we are not looking to bring additional developers into the team, but encourage anyone to view our source
        code. Our page can be found here: <a>https://github.com/defrancisco/My-Digital-Safe</a>

        <div class="faqQuestion">
            <div class="faqQuestionText">How does My Digital Safe secure my password?</div>
            <div class="faqQuestionArrow"><img src="images/arrow_down.png" class="arrow"/></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">My Digital Safe used the PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA256. This cryptographic hash function is
            used to derive the hash to validate your password and ultimately
            derive the symmetric encryption key to protect your data. Simple version? We take your password and turn it
            into a irreversible garbled mess of characters using a 'hashing' function.
            Some very smart Mathematicians create and validate the effectiveness of this hashing function and security
            developers such as ourselves can use it in our applications. This 'hash'
            is impossible to convert back into your password, and we can re-calculate the hash each time you log in. If
            the hash we calculate matches the stored hash, your login is successful.
            Interesting, right?

                                                                              class="arrow"/></div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">We encrypt all of your data using AES-256 algorithm before storing it in a database on
            your phone. The key to this algorithm is calculate through the PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA256
            algorithm during the password hashing process. In simplified terms, we use your password to encrypt and
            decrypt your data. Without your password, this data is impossible to decrypt.
            No matter what we do for you, if someone steals or guesses your password, we cannot help you. Therefore,
            pick a good password if you really care about your data's security!
